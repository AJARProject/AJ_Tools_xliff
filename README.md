# AJ_Tools_xliff

AJ_Tools_xliff is a component developed with 4D V17 R6. Its use is intended for 4D developers and translators. It allows you to manage the XLIFF translations of your 4D application.
The component gives you a nice interface to manage the strings of your application.

## How XLIFF works?
4D uses xliff files to manage translations in an application. For more details, I invite you to read more on the 4D Documentation : [Appendix C : XLIFF architecture](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv17/4D/17.4/Appendix-C-XLIFF-architecture.300-4880798.en.html)

You can also refer to the official [XLIFF 1.1 Specification](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/documents/xliff-specification.htm)
